## About
Hi! I'm a 2nd year Robotics PhD at Stanford University. I'm super fortunate to be co-advised by [Monroe Kennedy III](https://monroekennedy3.com) and [C. Karen Liu](https://profiles.stanford.edu/c-karen-liu).

Before PhD, I received my MS degree from Stanford AeroAstro with a focus on Robotics.

Many many years ago, I had a very happy 4 years in UIUC, where I also received my BS degree in Aerospace Engineering! I worked as an undergrad researcher in Prof. [Tim Bretl](https://aerospace.illinois.edu/directory/profile/tbretl)'s group, whom I'm extremely grateful to for introducing me into this wild world of robotics!

You probably wondered why my avatar is some random guy riding motorcycle...
