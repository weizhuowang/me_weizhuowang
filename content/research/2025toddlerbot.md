**Abstract:**
Learning-based robotics research driven by data demands a new approach to robot hardware design—one that serves as both a platform for policy execution and a tool for embodied data collection to train policies. We introduce ToddlerBot, a low-cost, open-source humanoid robot platform designed for scalable policy learning and research in robotics and AI. ToddlerBot enables seamless acquisition of high-quality simulation and real-world data. The plug-and-play zero-point calibration and transferable motor system identification ensure a high-fidelity digital twin, enabling zero-shot policy transfer from simulation to the real-world. A user-friendly teleoperation interface facilitates streamlined real-world data collection for learning motor skills from human demonstrations. Utilizing its data collection ability and anthropomorphic design, ToddlerBot is an ideal platform to perform whole-body loco-manipulation. Additionally, ToddlerBot’s compact size (0.56 m, 3.4 kg) ensures safe operation in real-world environments. Reproducibility is achieved with an entirely 3D-printed, open-source design and commercially available components, keeping the total cost under 6000 USD. Comprehensive documentation allows assembly and maintenance with basic technical expertise, as validated by a successful independent replication of the system. We demonstrate ToddlerBot’s capabilities through arm span, payload, endurance tests, loco-manipulation tasks, and a collaborative long-horizon scenario where two robots tidy a toy session together. By advancing ML-compatibility, capability, and reproducibility, ToddlerBot provides a robust platform for scalable learning and dynamic policy execution in robotics research.
